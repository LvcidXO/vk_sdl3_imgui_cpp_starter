# SDL3, Vulkan, ImGui Starter Kit for Productivity Apps

A starter kit for working with SDL3, Vulkan, and ImGui to create an app. Library-rich for productivity based applications. Forked from a fork of Codotaku's vk_sdl (https://github.com/ilyas-taouaou/vk_sdl) with changes to suit C++ development and a bunch of additional libraries for productivity based applications - editting video, audio, scripts, and other data with a modern set of tools.

Codotaku's original video on vk_sdl:
